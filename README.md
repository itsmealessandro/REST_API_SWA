# AuleWeb RESTful Service

## Overview
This RESTful service provides an API for managing classrooms and events within the AuleWeb application. It leverages the AuleWeb database to store and retrieve information about classrooms, equipment, and events. 

## Features
* **Authentication:**
    * Login/logout for administrators using username and password.
    * Secure authentication using session tokens or API keys.
* **Classroom Management:**
    * Export and import classroom configurations in CSV format.
    * Create new classrooms.
    * Assign classrooms to groups.
    * Retrieve basic information about a classroom.
    * List equipment available in a classroom.
* **Event Management:**
    * Create new events.
    * Modify existing events.
    * Retrieve information about an event.
    * List events associated with a specific classroom in a given week.
    * List current and upcoming events within the next three hours.
    * Export all events within a specified time interval in iCalendar format (using ical4j).

## RESTful API Endpoints
